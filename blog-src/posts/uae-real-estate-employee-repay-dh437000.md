## Background

In a recent UAE court ruling, a real estate employee was ordered to repay Dh437,000 after being found guilty of embezzling company funds. The case, though specific, reflects a recurring issue across many UAE businesses — weak accounting systems and the absence of effective internal controls.

The company had trusted its internal staff to manage cash flows, client receipts, and vendor payments. But over time, inadequate monitoring and unchecked transactions created the perfect opportunity for misappropriation. By the time the fraud was detected, the financial loss was significant — and the company’s reputation had already suffered.

## Dispute Summary

The court investigation revealed several warning signs that had gone unnoticed for years:

- ❌ No periodic reconciliations of company accounts.
- ❌ Lack of management oversight over day-to-day financial activities.
- ❌ Improper segregation of duties — one employee controlled both receipts and payments.
- ❌ No independent audit or external verification of accounts.
- ❌ Irregular documentation for cash and bank transactions.

Each of these failures points to one root cause — a lack of structured accounting controls.

## The Missing Control — A Costly Mistake

Had the company implemented a proper accounting system and internal audit process, the discrepancies could have been detected much earlier. Regular monitoring and independent review would have flagged issues like:

- Unrecorded receipts
- Unexplained transfers
- Unsupported expense claims
- Delayed reconciliations
- Unapproved disbursements

A simple monthly financial review or audit could have prevented the loss — saving both money and management’s peace of mind.

## Lessons for UAE Businesses

This case reinforces an essential truth: trust must be supported by transparent financial processes. Even in small or medium-sized businesses, every transaction should be verified, approved, and documented. Here’s how every UAE company can safeguard itself:

- ✅ Maintain proper books of accounts and ensure every transaction is backed by documentation.
- ✅ Establish internal controls so responsibilities for payments, receipts, and approvals are segregated.
- ✅ Conduct regular reconciliations, especially monthly bank and ledger reviews, to spot anomalies early.
- ✅ Appoint independent auditors or advisors who can provide an external review for transparency and compliance.
- ✅ Implement approval workflows so no single individual has unchecked financial authority.

## Conclusion

The Dh437,000 embezzlement case is a clear reminder — financial control is not optional. Every company, big or small, must prioritise accurate accounting and independent oversight. One missed reconciliation can cost thousands. One timely audit can save a business. In today’s fast-paced business world, transparency and accountability are your strongest assets.
