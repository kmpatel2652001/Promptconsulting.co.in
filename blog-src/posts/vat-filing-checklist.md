Staying compliant with the UAE Federal Tax Authority requires a disciplined approach to VAT record keeping. Before you log in to the EmaraTax portal, make sure you have reconciled your sales, purchase, and expense ledgers so that VAT collected and recoverable VAT are both accurate.

Key steps in our checklist include:

1. Reconciling revenue, credit notes, and zero-rated sales.
2. Verifying VAT treatment for imports and reverse-charge transactions.
3. Reviewing supporting documents for expense claims, particularly mixed-use costs.
4. Preparing payment approvals so the remittance can be made ahead of the deadline.

A short review meeting with finance or management can prevent surprises. Schedule that discussion at least five days before filing so that any adjustments can be reflected in the return and supporting schedules.
